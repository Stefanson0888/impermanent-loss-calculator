### Example Calculation:
1. **Select Protocol:** Uniswap V3
2. **Set Prices:** Initial $3000 → Current $3500 (ETH example)  
3. **Pool APY:** 25% (typical for ETH/USDT)
4. **Investment:** $1000
5. **Results:** See IL impact vs fees earned + break-even analysis

## 🧮 How It Works

### Supported Formulas:

**Classic AMM (Uniswap V2, SushiSwap):**
```
IL = (2 × √(price_ratio) / (1 + price_ratio)) - 1
```

**Concentrated Liquidity (Uniswap V3, PancakeSwap V3):**
```
Enhanced IL calculation with concentration factor adjustments
```

**StableSwap (Curve):**
```
Minimal IL for correlated assets with specialized formula
```

**Weighted Pools (Balancer):**
```
Custom weight ratios (80/20, 60/40) for reduced IL exposure
```

### Fee Calculations:
- **Daily/Weekly/Monthly** earnings breakdown
- **Break-even time** analysis
- **Total return** including fees vs pure IL

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18 + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Frontend + API)
- **APIs:** Real-time data from major DEX protocols

## 📈 Use Cases

- **Risk Assessment** - Calculate potential IL before entering pools
- **Strategy Planning** - Compare different protocols and pairs
- **Fee Analysis** - Estimate earnings from trading fees
- **Portfolio Optimization** - Find the best risk/reward balance

### For DeFi Researchers:
- **Protocol Comparison** - Analyze different AMM mechanisms
- **Educational Tool** - Understand IL mechanics across platforms
- **Market Analysis** - Study correlation between volume, fees, and IL

### For DeFi Educators:
- **Teaching Aid** - Visual examples of IL concepts
- **Scenario Modeling** - Show impact of different market conditions
- **Glossary Reference** - Comprehensive DeFi terminology

## 🎯 Competitive Advantages

### vs Basic IL Calculators:
- ✅ **Multi-protocol support** (6 different AMMs)
- ✅ **Real-time fee integration** (not just theoretical IL)
- ✅ **Educational content** (learn while calculating)
- ✅ **Professional UI/UX** (dark mode, responsive)

### vs DeFi Dashboards:
- ✅ **Specialized focus** on IL analysis
- ✅ **Scenario modeling** for planning
- ✅ **Break-even calculations** for decision making
- ✅ **Free to use** with comprehensive features

## 🔮 Perfect For:

- **🏦 DeFi Investors** - Planning LP strategies
- **🎓 Crypto Learners** - Understanding IL mechanics  
- **📊 Portfolio Managers** - Risk assessment tools
- **🏗️ Protocol Teams** - Educational resources for users
- **📝 Content Creators** - IL education and examples

## 🌟 Why This Tool Matters

**Impermanent Loss is the #1 risk for liquidity providers**, yet most calculators only show basic IL without considering:
- ✅ Trading fee earnings (can completely offset IL)
- ✅ Different AMM mechanisms (Curve vs Uniswap behave differently)  
- ✅ Real market data (theoretical calculations miss the full picture)
- ✅ Education (users need to understand what they're calculating)

**This calculator bridges that gap** with professional-grade analysis that considers the complete picture.

## 📊 Sample Results

```
Input: ETH $3000 → $3500, $1000 investment, 25% APY

HODL Strategy:    $1,083  (+8.3%)
LP Strategy:      $1,061  (+6.1%) 
LP + Fees:        $1,082  (+8.2%)

Impermanent Loss: -$22 (-2.2%)
Fees Earned:      +$21 (Break-even: ~30 days)
Winner: HODL (by $1)
```
