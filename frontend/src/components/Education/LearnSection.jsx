The bigger the change, the more you are exposed to impermanent loss. The loss is 'impermanent' because it only becomes permanent when you withdraw your liquidity.",

        title: "How do AMMs Work?",

The most common formula is x * y = k (constant product), where x and y are the quantities of two tokens, and k is a constant. When someone trades, they change this ratio, which affects prices.",

        title: "Trading Fees: The IL Compensation",
        content: "When you provide liquidity, you earn a portion of trading fees (typically 0.25-0.3% per trade). These fees accumulate over time and often compensate for impermanent loss, especially in high-volume pools. The key is finding pools where fee income exceeds IL.",
